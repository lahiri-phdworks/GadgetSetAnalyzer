# GadgetSetAnalyzer
A security-oriented static binary analysis tool for comparing the quantity, quality, and locality of code reuse gadget sets in program variants.

If you use this tool in your research, please cite the following paper:

GSA has been updated to include new metrics since the publication of this paper.  The expanded version of the paper that includes expanded metrics is available here:

Software Debloating Doesnâ€™t Necessarily Indicate Improved Security" arXiv:1902.10880v3 [cs.CR]. 2019.**[\[pdf\]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.10880.pdf)

## Description
The analyzer component is an automated tool for gathering security-oriented data on the effects of software transformation. It takes as input an original software package binary that has not been transformed, and at least one transformed variant of that package. It produces as output the following data files:

 1. Functional Gadget Set Expressivity Change: The change in expressivity between the original package and each variant.
 2. Gadget Count Reduction: The change in overall gadget count between the original package and each variant.
 3. Gadget Introduction: The rate at which new gadgets are introduced by software transformation.
 4. Special Purpose Gadget Count Reduction: Same as 2, but for sepcial purpose gadgets.
 5. Special Purpose Gadget Introduction: Same as 3, but for special purpose gadgets.
 6. Gadget Locality: The percentage of gadgets in a variant set that are also in present in the original set and also at the same offset.
 7. Functional Gadget Set Quality Change: The change in quality (as measured by ease of use and the absence of side constraints) of the gadget set between the original package and each variant.
 8. Likely Gadget Locations: For each introduced special purpose gadget, the most likely function name in source where the gadget was introduced.

## Dependencies
The static analyzer is dependent upon the following third party packages:

 1. ROPgadget (SRI verison) - for collecting gadget based information from binaries.
 2. Gality (GT version) - for generating functional gadget set quality data.
 3. angr - for finding source code functions associated with introduced gadgets.

## Installing
To install the analyzer:

 1. Install ROPgadget (https://github.com/SRI-CSL/ROPgadget)
 2. Install angr (https://docs.angr.io/introductory-errata/install)
 3. Clone and build the GT version of Gality (https://github.com/michaelbrownuc/gality)
 4. Clone this repo
 5. Set the galityPath variable on line 22 of src/static_analyzer/GadgetSet.py to your local path.


## Running
The analyzer has 2 optional inputs:

 1. Output Metrics (--output_metrics): Indicates that the analyzer should produce output files 1-7.
 2. Output Addresses (--output_addresses): Indicates that the analyzer should produce output file 8.

The analyzer has 2 required inputs:

 1. Original Binary: Filepath to the original binary.
 2. Variant Labels / Binaries: Python Dictionaty consisting of variant names and filepaths to their binaries.

Example invocation:
```
 python3 src/GSA.py --output_metrics --output_addresses ./samples/CHISEL/date/date-8.21.origin ./samples/CHISEL/date/date-8.21.reduced 
```
